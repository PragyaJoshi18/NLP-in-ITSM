# NLP-in-ITSM
An organisation is operating in IT-enabled business segment over a decade. On an average it receives 22-25k IT incidents/tickets, which are handled to best practice by ITIL framework with incident management, problem management, change management and configuration management processes. This organisation is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor. In this project, i am going to apply Machine Learning to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation.

Usecase : Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.
Cluster similar Tickets
